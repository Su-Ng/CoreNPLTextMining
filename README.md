Employers are required to report any serious work-replated injuries and death to the authority. This information helps employers, workers and the authority to evalute the safety of the workplace, understand industry hazards, and implement worker protection to reduce and implement worker protections to reduce and eliminate hazards. The objective of the project is to perform text-mining on the accident report of 10 000 records to help answer the following question:
What are the major types of accidents reflected in the reports?
Which type of accidents are more common?
Can we find out more risky occupations in such accidents?
Which part of the body is injured the most?

The results show that:

The riskiest occupations in order, from the data shown below:

Driver has 446 incident reports.

CoreNLP is a NLP toolkit with a broad range of grammatical analysis tool, we get nouns from the dataset. Using wordNet, we obtain hyponymns which are children words which are words that is a more specified word than a given word.

In this repository, I have included the dataset used Osha.txt and the programs used DataExploring.R and DataMining.R
